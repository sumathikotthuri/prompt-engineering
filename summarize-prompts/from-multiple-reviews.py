Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.

# review for a standing lamp
review_2 = """
Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one \
had additional storage and not too high of a price \
point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string \
to the lamp broke during the transit and the company \
happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days \
as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a \
missing part, so I contacted their support and they \
very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me \
to be a great company that cares about their customers \
and products.

# review for an electric toothbrush
review_3 = """
My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \
which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be \
pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and \
leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \
condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \
been using it for twice daily brushing for the last \
3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different \
length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \
toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \
every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean!
